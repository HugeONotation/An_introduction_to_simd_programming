\chapter{Branchless Programming}
One of the primary challenges that is encountered with SIMD programming is the
existence of branching. This is only natural given that the entire purpose of
branches is to perform different operations based on the values contained within
the input data stream, and at the same time, SIMD often seeks to process
multiple elements in a uniform manner. However, that's not so say that every
branch is a showstopper. Many simple branches may be replaced through carefully
crafted instruction sequences. In same cases, even loops maps be implemented in
a manner which is suitable for .

\section{Masked Instructions}
Certain newer SIMd instruction sets, such as AVX-512, AVX10, and SVE provide a
dedicated masking feature.

x86's masking feature set comes in two forms.

\section{Conditional Arithmetic}


\textbf{Conditional Increment} Conditionally incrementing may be done by
utilizing an addition instruction where one operand is the result of a
comparison mask.

\textbf{Conditional Decrement} Conditionally incrementing may be done by
utilizing a subtraction instruction where one operand is the result of a
comparison mask.

\textbf{Conditional Addition}

\textbf{Conditional Subtraction}
