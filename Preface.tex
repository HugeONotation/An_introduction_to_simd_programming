\chapter*{Preface}
This book seeks to be a practical introduction to the world of SIMD programming for those who are
interested in writing well-optimized code and making the most of their CPUs. This book will focus on
the x86 and ARM instruction sets. It will take a look at x86's SSE, AVX, AVX512, and AVX10
extensions, as well as ARM's Neon and SVE instruction sets.

It's assumed that the reader has a rudimentary understanding of computer architecture and is
comfortable working in a C-like programming language, but it assumes little else. It is useful, but
not necessary, to know how to program in assembly since there will be a large focus on how to
program by composing individual instructions.
